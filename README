# 🃏 Playing Card Collection REST API

A RESTful API built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to manage a collection of playing cards.  
This project demonstrates CRUD operations and API testing using Postman.

## 📌 Objective

To develop a RESTful API for managing a playing card collection using Express.js and test the endpoints using Postman.

## 🚀 Features

- Create a new playing card
- View all playing cards
- View a single card by ID
- Update a card
- Delete a card
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Modular folder structure (Routes + Controllers)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js (v18+)
- Express.js
- CORS
- Postman (for API testing)
